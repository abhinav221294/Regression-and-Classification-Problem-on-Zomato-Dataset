Section A: Title: Regression model

Problem:
Restaurants from all over the world can be found here in Bengaluru. From the United States 
to Japan, Russia to Antarctica, you get all types of cuisines here. Delivery, Dine-out, Pubs, 
Bars, Drinks, Buffet, Desserts you name it and Bengaluru has it. Bengaluru is the best place 
for foodies. The number of restaurants is increasing day by day. Currently, it stands at 
approximately 12,000 restaurants. With such a high number of restaurants. This industry 
hasn't been saturated yet. And new restaurants are opening every day. However, it has 
become difficult for them to compete with already established restaurants. The key issues 
that continue to pose a challenge to them include high real estate costs, rising food costs, 
shortage of quality manpower, fragmented supply chain, and over-licensing. 

Objective:
The newly started companies are not able to decide the cost that would happen per 
two people for once. So the Zomato company has a good analyst team who can predict the 
cost per two customers for one time so that the newly started restaurants and upcoming 
restaurants will be well prepared how the restaurant should invest in improving the 
ambiance and all other stuff to attract the customers. Assume you are the analyst team that 
Zomato has organized to help new and upcoming restaurants by letting them know the 
various reasons that customers look for and build a model which able to predict the cost for 
two people.

Section B: Title: Classification

Problem Statement:

The model that you built in the above case study has gone to deployment and Zomato has 
been impressed with your data analysis and Zomoto has been believing that your analysis 
going to be impactful. Now Zomato has been observing the orders happening online and 
offline, Due to offline orders, Zomato is not able to attract customers with diverse items and 
offers, and the user subscription also getting low. so it has decided to give you the project 
on the same. Now the problem statement is that Zomato wants to know whether the 
customer would order the orders online or offline so that Zomato can take further 
strategies to improve the online order.

Objective:
The Aim is to classify the orders that have been ordered online and offline. And 
identify the patterns that lead to orders online orders as well as offline. Your model should 
be able to classify the classes effectively.
